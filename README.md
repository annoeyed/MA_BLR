# 🕷️ MultiAgent-Backdoor-Loop-Research

A research framework for simulating, detecting, and defending against backdoor loop attacks in LLM-based multi-agent systems.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project simulates multi-agent backdoor attacks with realistic communication patterns, and provides detection/defense pipelines for empirical evaluation.  
It supports attack types such as:

- Cooperative backdoor injection  
- Spatiotemporal trigger activation  
- Trust exploitation during role delegation  
- Distributed backdoor activation across agents
